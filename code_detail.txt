What makes a chocolate, the Best Chocolate Bar?
High-quality chocolates are those created with the best beans and artisan processes, which provide the consumer with a smooth texture and uniform flavor.

The chocolates with the brightest appearance, are the ones that finally have a higher price.

The flavor is the most notable distinction between conventional chocolate and premium chocolate. Regardless of its origin, a good chocolate connoisseur will always look for the option that melts in the mouth. It is necessary to understand the qualities of gourmet chocolate bars to understand what the market is looking for from manufacturers. Let's see what makes a chocolate the best!

What will we analyze in this report?

We will analyze what makes a chocolate bar the best option, based on the information of 2485 chocolate bars. they were made from beans from 40 countries of origin and manufactured by 572 companies. Some factors were considered, such as the grade, the percentage of cocoa, the amount of ingredients and the ingredients.

There are three negative indicators of chocolate bars. These are the amount of cocoa it has, the origin of the beans, associated with two particular countries. And whether or not it has Lecithin, bars without Lecithin are perceived as more flavorful.

It's a good place to start to understand consumer preferences for how pure they expect their chocolate bars to be.

The general trend in consumer preference is that 3 ingredients can achieve a good gourmet chocolate bar, regardless of origin, and that if it has fewer or more ingredients, a decrease in the quality of the bar is perceived. We will analyze in graph 4 the influence of a particular ingredient lecithin.

As shown in Graph 1, the score of the countries of origin of the bean ranges between 2.7 and 3.6. A chocolate bar made with beans from Tobago gets the highest rating, followed by China and Sao Tome & Principe. The Puerto Rican beans made the chocolate bar less tasty. Let's continue investigating in other plots how the origin influences the rating.

Bars reviewed for each of those countries

Graph 2 presents the number of chocolate bars reviewed for each country of origin of the bean. The number varies from 1 to 253.

Of the 62 countries of origin for beans, nearly half of them have fewer than 10 bars reviewed.

Is the cacao bean's origin an indicator of quality?

When the number of chocolate bars reviewed is less than 10 bars, the distribution in the rating is random and does not result in a good rating index.

England and Switzerland have the most variability in their qualification scores. Although Denmark does not have a high rating compared to other countries, it has never had a bad rating. Although the US has the most chocolate reviews over the years, it has an average rating compared to other countries. Switzerland has chocolates with really promising scores, but due to the high variability of the scores, it seems that it also suffered bad reviews, this may be due to higher expectations for the origin of the chocolate bar from Switzerland. Poland and SÃ£o TomÃ© have the most extreme grade point average, but since they have a very low number of observations, the result is not strong.

For a chocolate bar with a rating above 3.5, the average cocoa per cent (70.95%) is lower than the average cocoa per cent (71.64%) of all chocolate bar. Chocolate bars with a rating above 3.5 the average cocoa per cent (70.9%) is lower than the average cocoa per cent (71.6%) of all chocolate bar.

We can infer that the higher the rating, the lower the chocolate percentage appears to be. Chocolates with 70-71% cocoa are expected to have the highest ratings. Although there is a negative relationship between cocoa content and mean rating, cocoa percent and ratings are not correlated.

Comparing the average rating of bars with and without lecithin (L in the ingredients).

The graph shows the difference in rating between chocolate bars with and without lecithin. For chocolate bars without lecithin as ingredients, the average rating is 3.2. For chocolate bars with lecithin as one of the ingredients, the average rating is 3.1. There's slight difference (1%) between rating and the lecithin usage in chocolates. It shows that including lecticin decreases the perceived quality of chocolate.

Summary
The average rating of review by origin range from 2.7 to 3.6 and there are more chocolate bars with rating higher than 3.
Most of the cholocolate bars have 3 ingredients
The number of review by origin range from 1 to 253
Average rating of the chocolate bar is highest for the country Tobago
Average rating of the chocolate bar is lowest for the country Puerto Rico
Cocoa bean's origin is not an indicator of quality, There does not seem to be any significant difference between the location of the company and its chocolate ratings, with all companies sharing almost the same discrepancy and rating ranges.
Including Lecticin among the ingredients decreases the perceived quality of the chocolate, and should not be included. Although this is a small difference in the average rating with or without lecticin, when analyzing it together with the amount of ingredients chosen to make a good gourmet chocolate bar (3), it is advisable to refrain from the use of lecticin
